## Introduction

Nowadays, a personal website is a must-have for every professional. There are many services that offer drag-and-drop functionality that allows you to build your own website in a matter of minutes. However, the results of these programs are often cookie-cutter like websites that all look very similar and impersonal. Therefore, I have decided to build my very own website from scratch.

##### Goal of this project
The goal of this project was to create a professional lightweight full-stack web application that would serve as my personal website. It had to showcase my skills and my other projects while offering simple navigation experience and contact opportunities for potential employers or customers.


## Design

There were multiple ideas that were iterated through during the design process. I have consulted design specialists and common people alike to find a design that would be most fitting for this type of project while representing my personality and values. The final design consists of a polished minimalist interface combined with subtle modern design elements that give the overall website a very contemporary look.

Despite the simplicity of the website, colour theory was used extensively throughout the design process to assure communication of proper values and ideas towards customers:
- Purple - luxury, sophistication
- Pink - creativity, exquisiteness
- Grey - practicality, formalness
- Black - elegance, authority
- White - clarity, purity, simplicity
